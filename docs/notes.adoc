== Version 3.0

This is the first version of the Microsoft Entra OpenID Connect ID Provider app, but since it is a replacement of the previous Azure AD OIDC ID Provider app, it is released as version 3.0.

A migration guide from Azure AD OIDC ID Provider can be found <<migration#migration,here>>.

What's new in version 3 (compared to Azure AD OIDC ID Provider)

- Auto login with JWT Bearer token support
- multi-tenant organization configuration support
- new Redirect URI with deep linking support
- Authorization Code Flow with PKCE support
- clientSecret rotation support to avoid downtime from propagation delays
